# ü™ê Rapid-ts: (R)EST (A)PI (P)rovisioning and (I)ntegration with JSON (D)ata - in TypeScript

Rapid-ts is a project that allows you to create a REST API based on simple JSON configurations. This API stores its data in JSON files.

**Note: Rapid-ts is intended to be used as a test API for development purposes only. It is not recommended for building large-scale, production-ready, or secure APIs.**

A separate implementation is currently in development to serve as a simple Mock API, providing more advanced mocking and simulation capabilities.

## Features

- Easy Configuration: Rapid-ts enables developers to set up a REST API quickly and easily by using simple JSON configurations.

- RESTful API: Rapid-ts follows the principles of a RESTful architecture, allowing you to design your API with resources, endpoints, and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

- JSON Data Storage: Rapid-ts stores and retrieves data using JSON files. This approach simplifies data management and allows for easy integration with JSON-based systems.

- TypeScript Support: Rapid-ts is written in TypeScript, providing static typing and better tooling support for development.

## Getting Started

To get started with Rapid-ts, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rapid-ts.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```shell
cd rapid-ts
npm install
```

3. Configure your API:

Edit the `config.json` file in the project's root directory to define your API's resources, endpoints, and data.

4. Build and run the API server:

```shell
npm build
npm start
```

By default, the API server will run on `http://localhost:3000`. You can modify the port and other server configurations in the `config.json` file.

## Usage
